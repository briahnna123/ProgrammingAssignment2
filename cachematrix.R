## R Programming Assignment #2: "Caching the Inverse of a Matrix"
## The goal of this assignemnt is to create two functions: 
## One that caches the inverse values for an invertiable matrix
## One that calculates inverse values for a matrix if not already cached




makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
